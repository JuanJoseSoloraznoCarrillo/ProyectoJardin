# Empresa Jardín

## Overview

This project is a school exercise designed to help students learn the Java programming language by creating a console-based application for managing a gardening company. The application allows users to manage employees, clients, gardens, and contracts through a menu-driven interface.

## Description

The `EmpresaJardín.java` class is the main entry point of the application. It provides a menu-driven interface for performing various operations related to employees, clients, gardens, and contracts. The application uses arrays to store instances of `Empleado`, `Cliente`, `Jardin`, and `Contrato` classes.

### Main Menu Options

1. **Empleados**: Manage employees (add, remove, consult, modify, and check salary).
2. **Clientes**: Manage clients (add, remove, consult, and modify).
3. **Jardín**: Manage gardens (add, remove, consult, and modify).
4. **Crear contrato**: Manage contracts (create, consult, modify, and delete).
5. **Salir**: Exit the application.
